 (1) "The goal of this paper is to endow language models with the ability to generate a similar chain of thought —a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal answer for a problem." (2) "We sample examples ≤60tokens to ﬁt into our input context window, and also limit the examples to ≤2 steps to solve for a fair comparison with the eight exemplars that we composed." (3) "Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results? [N/A]"
